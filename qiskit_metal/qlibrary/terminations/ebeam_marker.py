        Markers

    Creates 4 sets of markers for EBPG marker search. 
    The (0,0) point is the centre of these 4 markers.
    For how their named one can check the drawing below. 
    2 Dimensional Cartesian Coordinate System is the way how they are named.

    Sketch:
        Below is a sketch of one the marker set.
