Creating TWINS sample

- cheesing setting arranged for pos_x, pos_y = 0,0
Fot this design should be (5,0)
Could not find any position option in GDS library maybe design library will be helpfull.

Try to figure out how to calculate opentoground position with codes. Not by hand. Needs to calculate whatever TL line position is.
